We made the DevSecOps Pipeline in the following steps
1 . Setup an instance of SonarQube on the localhost port 9000
2 . Created a token for this intance to be used with jenkins
3 . Started Jenkins as a service on windows
4 . Configured a task as a freestyle project
5 . Used the github repo link under source code mgmt tab
6 . Added a step to execute this instance of SonarQube when the build runs
7. Added a project in SonarQube as "Info Sec Project" and gave it a name and a key
8. Added the project name and key in sonarproperties files that must be present in the github repo
9. Started the build, the build successfully completes generating a report of code analysis
10. To integrate snyK with the pipeline, first I had to make and account on snyk website
11. Added app.py and requirements.txt as snyk doesnt support html/css projects
12. Found out the API token from Snyk's website and supplied it in Jenkins
13. Started the build and found out low severity issues in the build
